# Customizable Clock Wallpaper for Wallpaper Engine

A lightweight and highly optimized wallpaper for **Wallpaper Engine** with a few in-app customization options.

The color scheme and font are based on my favorite code editor setup, using the **Rider font** and colors.

## Features

- **Optimized Performance:** Minimal CPU usage. Updates once per second or per minute depending on settings.
- **Customizable Options:** Adjust settings such as showing seconds, choosing 12/24-hour format, and displaying the period (AM/PM).
- **Code Editor Inspired:** Uses Rider font and color theme for a clean, developer-friendly look.
